My solutions for Advent of Code 2022 implemented entirely in the type system of TypeScript.

Because the type system can't calll the filesystem, input is treated as a (very large) string literal type that the solution types operate on.

To see the solutions work, open this code in a type-aware editor like vscode or the [typescript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play).
